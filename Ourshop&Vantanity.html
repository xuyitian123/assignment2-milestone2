<h2>FAQ Questions</h2>
<p>Q:How many tropical fish can I have?</p>
<p>A:The often stated general rule of thumb (don't stock your tank using this rule!) is 1 inch of fish per gallon of water. Remember to use the future adult size of your fish when computing the total inches of fish you can have.</p>
<p>Q:Can I use tap water to fill my tank? </p>

<p>A:Maybe - first for chlorine and or chloramines. Most likely you will have these chemicals in your water and you will need to remove or neutralize them before adding water to your tank.</p> 
<p>Q:How often should I change the water? </p>

<p>A:It depends on how many fish you have and the quality of your filtration system. In lightly stocked tanks, I would recommend changing 10 percent of the water once a week.</p> 
<p>Q:How often should I feed my tropical fish? </p>
<p>A:It is best to give your fish two or three small feedings per day. Only give an amount of food that the fish can eat in 2 minutes or less. </p>
